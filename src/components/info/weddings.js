          <p>Javed is Muslim so we have decided to have a Shariah wedding first of all.  As part of this ceremony, Javed is required to throw a party for his brides friends and family.  We have decided to combine this with our engagement celebrations. </p>
          <p>Charlotte is Christian and she wouldnt feel properly married without a church blessing which we will combine with our legal wedding.</p>
          <p>We do hope, regardless of your personal beliefs, that you, our friends and family will want to support us throughout our wedding celebrations and marriage.</p>

          <h3>Our Celebrations</h3>

          <p>In line with Javeds beliefs, we plan to arrange our Shariah marriage as soon as possible.</p>
