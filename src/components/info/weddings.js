          <h3>Our Celebrations</h3>

          <p>We will have the ceremony at Javs house with just our immediate family.  As part of the arrangement, Javed is required (and delighted to!) throw a party for Charlottes friends and family.  We would be delighted if you could join us for this day.</p>
          <p>We plan to host a barbeque in the back garden of Javeds family home. Javed has booked the bouncy castles and promised Charlotte an ice-cream van! We hope to see as many of you there as who feel comfortable attending.  This will be the start of Javed and Charlotte creating their married life together and so as part of that we hope our friends and family will enjoy getting to know each other at this party and at other events we plan to throw in the future! Please note that in respect of Muslim customs, this event will be alcohol-free.</p>
